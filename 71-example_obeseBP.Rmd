## Purpose

### Research Question

> Is obsesity associated with higher blood pressure and is that relationship the same among men and women?



### Data Description


This dataset is included in the `ISwR` package [@R-ISwR], which was a companion to the texbook "Introductory Statistics with R, 2nd ed." [@dalgaard2008], although it was first published by @brown1977.  

To view the documentation for the dataset, type `?bp.obese` in the console and enter or search the help tab for `bp.obese'.

> The `bp.obese` data frame has 102 rows and 3 columns. It contains data from a random sample of Mexican-American adults in a small California town.

This data frame contains the following columns:

* `sex` a numeric vector code, 0: male, 1: female
* `obese` a numeric vector, ratio of actual weight to ideal weight from New York Metropolitan Life Tables
* `bp` a numeric vector,systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)


```{r bpobesedata}
data(bp.obese, package = "ISwR")

bp.obese <- bp.obese %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(sex = factor(sex,
                             labels = c("Male", "Female"))) 

tibble::glimpse(bp.obese)
```



## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before embarking on any inferencial anlaysis or modeling, always get familiar with your variables one at a time *(univariate)*, as well as pairwise *(bivariate)*.


### Univariate Statistics

Summary Statistics for all three variables of interest [@R-stargazer].

```{r, results='asis'}
bp.obese %>% 
  stargazer::stargazer(type = "html")
```

### Bivariate Relationships

The `furniture` package's `table1()` function is a clean way to create a descriptive table that compares distinct subgroups of your sample [@R-furniture].

```{r, results='asis'}
bp.obese %>% 
  furniture::table1(obese, bp,
                    splitby = ~ sex,
                    test = TRUE,
                    output = "html")  
```

The `ggpairs()` function in the `GGally` package is helpful for showing all pairwise relationships in raw data, especially seperating out two or three groups [@R-GGally].

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(bp.obese,
                mapping = aes(fill      = sex,
                              col       = sex,
                              alpha     = 0.1),
                upper = list(continuous = "smooth",
                             combo      = "facethist",
                             discrete   = "ratio"),
                lower = list(continuous = "cor",
                             combo      = "box",
                             discrete   = "facetbar"),
                title = "Very Useful for Exploring Data") 
```



```{r}
bp.obese %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x    = sex, 
      y    = bp,
      fill = sex) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("mediumblue", "maroon3")) +
  labs(x = "Gender",
       y = "Blood Pressure (mmHg)") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```


Visual inspection for an interaction (is gender a moderator?)

```{r}
bp.obese %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x     = obese,
             y     = bp,
             color = sex)) +
  geom_point(size  = 3)  +
  geom_smooth(aes(fill = sex),
              alpha  = 0.2,
              method = "lm") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("mediumblue", "maroon3"),
                     breaks = c("male",       "female"),
                     labels = c("Men",        "Women")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values  = c("mediumblue", "maroon3"),
                    breaks  = c("male",       "female"),
                    labels  = c("Men",        "Women")) +
  labs(title = "Does Gender Moderate the Association Between Obesity and Blood Pressure?",
       x     = "Ratio: Actual Weight vs. Ideal Weight (NYM Life Tables)",
       y     = "Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)") + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks  = seq(from = 0,  to = 3,   by = 0.25 )) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks  = seq(from = 75, to = 300, by = 25)) +
  theme(legend.title         = element_blank(),
        legend.key           = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.background    = element_rect(color = "black"),
        legend.justification = c(1, 0), 
        legend.position      = c(1, 0))
```






```{r}
bp.obese %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(sex = as.numeric(sex)) %>%  # cor needs only numeric
  cor() %>% 
  round(3)
```


Often it is easier to digest a correlation matrix if it is visually presented, instead of just given as a table of many numbers.  The `corrplot` package has a useful function called `corrplot.mixed()` for doing just that [@R-corrplot].


```{r}
bp.obese %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(sex = as.numeric(sex)) %>%  # cor needs only numeric
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot.mixed(lower  = "ellipse",
                           upper  = "number",
                           tl.col = "black")
```




## Regression Analysis


### Fit Nested Models 
                   
The **bottom-up** approach consists of starting with an initial `NULL` model with only an intercept term and them building additional models that are nested.  

Two models are considered **nested** if one is conains a subset of the terms (predictors or IV) compared to the other.   


```{r}
fit_bp_null   <- lm(bp ~ 1,            data = bp.obese) # intercept only or NULL model
fit_bp_sex    <- lm(bp ~ sex,          data = bp.obese) 
fit_bp_obe    <- lm(bp ~ obese,        data = bp.obese)
fit_bp_obesex <- lm(bp ~ obese + sex,  data = bp.obese)
fit_bp_inter  <- lm(bp ~ obese*sex,    data = bp.obese)
```

### Comparing Nested Models


#### Model Comparison Table

In single level, multiple linear regression significance of predictors (independent variables, IV) is usually based on both the Wald tests of significance for each beta estimate (shown with stars here) and comparisons in the model fit via the $R^2$ values.

Again the `texreg` package comes in handy to display several models in the same tal e [@R-texreg].


```{r, results='asis'}
texreg::htmlreg(list(fit_bp_null,
                     fit_bp_sex, 
                     fit_bp_obe, 
                     fit_bp_obesex, 
                     fit_bp_inter),
                custom.model.names = c("No Predictors", 
                                       "Only Sex Quiz", 
                                       "Only Obesity", 
                                       "Both IVs", 
                                       "Add Interaction"))
```



#### Likelihood Ratio Test of Nested Models

An alternative method for determing model fit and variable importance is the likelihood ratio test.  This involves comparing the $-2LL$ or inverse of twice the log of the likelihood value for the model.  The difference in these values follows a Chi Squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters estimated *(number of betas)*.

* Test the main effect of math quiz:
```{r}
anova(fit_bp_null, fit_bp_sex)
```

* Test the main effect of math phobia
```{r}
anova(fit_bp_null, fit_bp_obe)
```


* Test the main effect of math phobia,  after controlling for math test
```{r}
anova(fit_bp_obe, fit_bp_obesex) 
```

* Test the interaction between math test and math phobia (i.e. moderation)
```{r}
anova(fit_bp_obesex, fit_bp_inter)
```




### Checking Assumptions via Residual Diagnostics

Before reporting a model, ALWAYS make sure to check the residules to ensure that the model assumptions are not violated.

```{r}
plot(fit_bp_obesex, which = 1)  
```


```{r}
plot(fit_bp_obesex, which = 4, id.n = 10)  # Change the number labeled
```

The `car` package has a handy function called `residualPlots()` for displaying residual plots quickly [@R-car].

```{r}
car::residualPlots(fit_bp_obesex)    
```

you can adjust any part of a ggplot
```{r}
bp.obese %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(e_bp = resid(fit_bp_obesex)) %>%  # add the resid to the dataset
  ggplot(aes(x     = sex,               # x-axis variable name
             y     = e_bp,              # y-axis variable name
             color = sex,               # color is the outline
             fill  = sex)) +            # fill is the inside
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,               # set at a meaningful value
             size       = 1,               # adjust line thickness
             linetype   = "dashed",        # set type of line
             color      = "purple") +      # color of line
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +                # level of transparency
  theme_bw() +                               # my favorite theme
  labs(title = "Check Assumptions",            # main title's text
       x = "Gender",                           # x-axis text label
       y = "Blood Pressure, Residual (bpm)") + # y-axis text label
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -40,    # declare a sequence of
                                  to   =  80,    # values to make the 
                                  by   =  20)) + # tick marks at
  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE)               # no legends included
```



```{r}
bp.obese %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(e_bp = resid(fit_bp_obesex)) %>%  # add the resid to the dataset
  ggplot(aes(x     = e_bp,              # y-axis variable name
             color = sex,               # color is the outline
             fill  = sex)) +            # fill is the inside
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,               # set at a meaningful value
             size       = 1,               # adjust line thickness
             linetype   = "dashed",        # set type of line
             color      = "purple") +      # color of line
  theme_bw() +                               # my favorite theme
  labs(title = "Check Assumptions",            # main title's text
       x = "Blood Pressure, Residual (bpm)") + # y-axis text label
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -40,    # declare a sequence of
                                  to   =  80,    # values to make the 
                                  by   =  20))  # tick marks at
```

## Conclusion

Violations to the assumtions call the reliabity of the regression results into question.  The data should be further investigated, specifically the $102^{nd}$ case.
